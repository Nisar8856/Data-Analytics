Series
A Series is very similar to a NumPy array (in fact it is built on top of the NumPy array object). What differentiates the NumPy array from a Series, is that a Series can have axis labels, meaning it can be indexed by a label, instead of just a number location. It also doesn't need to hold numeric data, it can hold any arbitrary Python Object.
